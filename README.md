# Udemy-clone-website
This project is a responsive frontend clone of Udemy, designed entirely using HTML and CSS to replicate the layout and visual design of the popular e-learning platform. It showcases my skills in structuring web pages, designing user interfaces, and creating responsive layouts without JavaScript.
